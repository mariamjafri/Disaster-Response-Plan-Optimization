# Disaster-Response-Plan-Optimization
Modeling and Analysis of Optimization of Disaster Relief based on factors for class: Nonlinear and Stochastic Optimization

This optimization problem is inspired by disaster relief plans, where we aim to determine the most efficient disaster response system, taking into consideration the severity of the disaster, the level of need, and the available inventory of supplies. Accordingly, this project develops the optimization model from scratch using simulation, of which the data is hypothetical.

**Key Features**
- Degree of freedom analysis
- Heat map analysis
- Sensitivity analysis using quantum computing

Tools

Python libraries: pyomo, NumPy, matplotlib
